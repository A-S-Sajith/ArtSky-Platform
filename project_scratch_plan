## Objective of the Project

 Studio practice in Fine art schools and higher Learning institutions can be modernized using current technology. 
 This will enable art institutions around the world to provide better opportunity for all. Art schools from the
 lesser privilaged countries will benifit more because this repository can help provide resources otherwise
 impossible or too costly to provide.
 Contemporary New media practice overlook the methodology of Fine Art study because of its radical nature. 
 The aim of this project is to develop radical new methods and tools  to assist art practicioners to study human figure,
 natural objects and phenomena, creative composition and design.
 If Tools and methods  are already existing and accessible, and if it can be re used or developed further  for 
 a specific purpose, it can be integrated into this project.
 The project is thematically huge so it will need a support system. 
 
 To begin with  the following category wise content and tool repos are proposed to be created.


# NeoStudio

Artists and art schools from around the world are finding it difficult to find life models for figure study. In some 
nations it may a taboo too. 
Ofcourse the emotional life of the character will be a future request.
