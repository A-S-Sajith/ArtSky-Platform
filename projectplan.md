## Objective of the Project
 Studio practice in Fine art centres can be modernized using current technology.  This will enable art institutions around the world to provide better opportunity for all. Art schools from the
 lesser privileged countries will benefit more because this repository can help provide resources otherwise
 impossible or too costly to provide.
 Contemporary New media practice overlook the methodology of Fine Art study because of its radical nature.
 The aim of this project is to develop radical new methods and tools  to assist art practitioners to study human figure,
 natural objects and phenomena, creative composition and design.
 If Tools and methods  are already existing and accessible, and if it can be re used or developed further  for
 a specific purpose, it can be integrated into this project.
 The project is thematically huge so it will need a support system.

 To begin with  the following category wise content and tool repos are proposed to be created.
